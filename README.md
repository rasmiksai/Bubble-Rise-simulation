# Bubble-Rise-simulation

This repository contains the implementation and results of a CFD simulation for the bubble rise problem, following the benchmark case presented by Hysing et al. The project aims to validate the numerical methods by comparing simulation results with the reference data provided by Hysing et al. using OpenFOAM.
Problem Setup: 2D simulation of a rising bubble in a fluid column.
Validation Metrics: Bubble shape, circularity, rise velocity, and centroid displacement.
